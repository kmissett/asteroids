# Javascript Asteroids

This is a Javascript canvas version of the old Atari game Asteroids, which is one of my all-time favorites. I followed a couple of tutorials, most notably one from freecodecamp, though I've used classes and multiple files instead of doing everything in index.js.

The game as of the initial commit isn't done. Here is what I still need to do:

* Add scores
* Add player lives
* Add levels
* Add sounds
* Add start/pause functionality
* Add screen text
* General refactoring

Things I might try, once the base game is complete:

* Player teleport function
* Game controller as input
* Two player mode
